## Assignment 1 (Score 100%):
- Decision Theory
- Fitted a Na√Øve Bayes model to the MNIST dataset and used this model for making predictions and generating
new images from the same distribution.

## Assignment 2 (Score 100%):
- Implemented the sum-product Loopy belief propagation (Loopy-BP) method for denoising binary images.
- Implemented a variant of the TrueSkill model, a player ranking system for competitive games originally
developed for Halo 2.
